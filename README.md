## About Me
Hello! I'm Aaron Hardgrave, a PhD Candidate in Biomedical Sciences at ETSU's Quillen College of Medicine in Johnson City, TN. I am passionate about Biology and further understanding the functional capabilities of the organisms around us. More specifically, I'm interested in comparative anatomy and morphology and using these techniques to describe the evolution of animal tissues (including us humans). 

## My Research
### Current Research Projects - PhD Dissertation
- **Ecomorphology's Role Shaping the Eastern Newt's Morphology:** Describe the functional morphology of eastern newts (_Notopthalmus viridescens_) across different ontogenetic life stages. We plan to compare the vertebral column (in review), limb skeleton, musculature, etc., through 3D Geometric Morphometrics and Finite Element Modeling techniques. 

### Other Research
- **Scapula - Old World vs New World Fruit Bats Climbing Mechanics:** This project was spearheaded by Dr. Rick Adams and Dr. Richard Carter. I assisted in the downstream analysis of the 3D landmark datasets. 
- **Acetabulum - Old World vs New World Fruit Bats Climbing Mechanics:** This project is led by an undergraduate researcher, Jay Higgins, and Dr. Richard Carter. I'm assisting in the 3D landmarking protocols and downstream analysis.
- **Vertebrae Shape - Old World vs New World Fruit Bats Climbing Mechanics:** This project is led by a graduate researcher, Jessica Upham, and Dr. Richard Carter. I'm assisting in the 3D landmarking protocols and downstream analysis.

## Techniques
- **micro-Computerized Tomography (ÂµCT):** Bruker1273 Skycan, Dragonfly, 3D Slicer
- **3D Geometric Morphometrics:** SlicerMorph, Geomorph, RRPP
- **Finite Element Analysis:** ANSYS 


## Interests
My interests include hiking, fly fishing, and scuba diving. In my free time, I enjoy working out, whether it be yoga or HIIT classes.
