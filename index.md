## About Me

Hello! I'm Aaron Hardgrave, a PhD Candidate in Biomedical Sciences at East Tennessee State University's Quillen College of Medicine in Johnson City, Tennessee. **I am expected to complete my dissertation and graduate in Spring 2026.**

I am passionate about understanding the functional capabilities of organisms through comparative anatomy and morphology. My research uses advanced imaging techniques (µCT scanning) and 3D geometric morphometrics to describe how animal form relates to function across development and different ecological contexts.

My journey into anatomy education began with comparative anatomy, studying how form and function are intricately connected across the animal kingdom. This fascination with biological design led me naturally to human anatomy, where I discovered a passion for sharing anatomical knowledge with diverse student populations—from medical students to undergraduates to high school students.

## Research Interests

My research interests span functional morphology and biomechanics across development, with particular emphasis on:

- **Comparative anatomy and morphology** - Understanding evolutionary adaptations in skeletal and muscular systems
- **Biomechanics across development** - Investigating how organisms adapt to different ecological niches throughout their life cycle
- **Advanced imaging and morphometrics** - Applying µCT scanning and 3D geometric morphometric techniques to biological questions
- **Anatomy education methods** - Integrating technology with traditional cadaver-based instruction to enhance student learning

## Current Position

PhD Candidate, Biomedical Sciences  
East Tennessee State University – Quillen College of Medicine  
Advisor: Dr. Richard T. Carter  
Concentration: Neuroscience
