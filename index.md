## About Me

Hello! I'm Aaron Hardgrave, a PhD Candidate in Biomedical Sciences at East Tennessee State University's Quillen College of Medicine in Johnson City, Tennessee. **I am expected to complete my dissertation and graduate in Spring 2026.**

I am passionate about understanding the functional capabilities of organisms through comparative anatomy and morphology. My research uses advanced imaging techniques (µCT scanning) and 3D geometric morphometrics to describe how animal form relates to function across development and different ecological contexts.

My journey into anatomy education began with comparative anatomy, studying how form and function are intricately connected across the animal kingdom. This fascination with biological design led me naturally to human anatomy, where I discovered a passion for sharing anatomical knowledge with diverse student populations—from medical students to undergraduates to high school students.

### Research Interests

- **Comparative anatomy and morphology** - Understanding evolutionary adaptations in skeletal and muscular systems
- **Biomechanics across development** - Investigating how organisms adapt to different ecological niches throughout their life cycle
- **Advanced imaging and morphometrics** - Applying µCT scanning and 3D geometric morphometric techniques to biological questions
- **Anatomy education methods** - Integrating technology with traditional cadaver-based instruction to enhance student learning

### Current Position

PhD Candidate, Biomedical Sciences
East Tennessee State University – Quillen College of Medicine
Advisor: Dr. Richard T. Carter
Concentration: Neuroscience

### Dissertation Research: Functional Morphology of the Eastern Newt

*Eastern newt volume renderings: Osteological elements (left) and diceCT soft tissue capture (right)*

**How does a newt's body shape change as it moves between water and land?**

Eastern newts (*Notophthalmus viridescens*) are remarkable amphibians that live in water as juveniles, move onto land as young adults, and then return to water to reproduce. This unique life cycle raises an intriguing question: does the newt's skeleton change shape to adapt to these different environments?

My research uses advanced 3D imaging technology (micro-CT scanning) to capture detailed pictures of newt skeletons across their different life stages. I then apply geometric morphometrics—a technique that analyzes and compares shapes mathematically—to measure exactly how the vertebral column, limbs, and muscles differ between aquatic and terrestrial newts.

Understanding how form relates to function in newts helps us understand broader principles of evolution and adaptation. It also provides insights into biomechanical constraints—the physical trade-offs animals face when their bodies must work in multiple environments.

## Teaching

### Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers on **functional understanding over memorization**. I believe anatomy students should develop the ability to visualize structures and infer their function based on anatomical relationships, preparing them to think anatomically in clinical practice rather than simply recall facts for examinations.

### Teaching Experience

**EAST TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY – QUILLEN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE**

*Instructor - Foundations of Medical Knowledge 2 – Anatomy Section* (Fall 2025)
- Co-instructed anatomy laboratory section (84 students) for Year 1 medical students (M1s)
- Covered thoracic, back, and abdominal regions including viscera and musculature
- Integrated clinical case studies with anatomical instruction

*Instructor - Brain, Body, Behavior – Anatomy Section* (Fall 2025)
- Co-instructed anatomy laboratory section (84 students) for Year 2 medical students (M2s)
- Covered upper and lower extremity anatomy

**EAST TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY – COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES**

*Instructor - Doctor of Occupational Therapy Program – Anatomy* (Summer 2025)
- Co-instructed anatomy laboratory sections for first-year occupational therapy students (30 students)
- Developed anatomical content tailored to occupational therapy clinical applications

**EAST TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY – COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES**

*Primary Instructor - Biology I & II for Majors* (Spring & Summer 2025)
- Primary instructor for undergraduate majors-level courses
- Intensive five-week residential program (Governor's School for Integration of Biological & Statistical Sciences)
- Covered organismal biology, ecology, evolution, and modern molecular techniques

*Laboratory Instructor* (2021-2024)
- Biochemistry of Macromolecules Lab (Fall 2022 - Spring 2024)
- Biochemistry of Metabolism Lab (Spring 2023 - Spring 2024)
- Comparative Anatomy Dissection Lab (Fall 2021)
- Biology for Non-Majors Lab (Spring 2021)

### Technology Integration

My research background in µCT imaging informs my teaching approach. I regularly integrate 3D iPad models alongside cadaveric specimens, allowing students to rotate structures and identify attachment points. However, I maintain that **technology should complement, not replace, cadaver-based instruction**—no digital tool can replicate the anatomical variation and spatial relationships students encounter in actual specimens.

### Courses Prepared to Teach

- Gross Human Anatomy (lecture and laboratory)
- Comparative Anatomy (lecture and laboratory)
- Embryology / Developmental Biology
- Neuroanatomy
- Functional Anatomy
