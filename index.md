## About Me

I study how animal form relates to function using advanced imaging and 3D morphometrics. My dissertation investigates skeletal and muscular adaptations in Eastern newts (*Notophthalmus viridescens*) as they transition between aquatic and terrestrial environments — work that informs broader questions about vertebrate evolution and biomechanics.

I'm equally passionate about anatomy education, teaching medical students, health sciences students, and undergraduates to think anatomically rather than simply memorize structures.

**How does a newt's body shape change as it moves between water and land?**

Eastern newts live in water as juveniles, move onto land as young adults, and then return to water to reproduce. My research uses micro-CT scanning and geometric morphometrics to measure exactly how the vertebral column, limbs, and muscles differ between aquatic and terrestrial stages — revealing how skeletal form adapts to the demands of different environments.
