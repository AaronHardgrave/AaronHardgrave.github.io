**How does a newt's body shape change as it moves between water and land?**

Eastern newts (*Notophthalmus viridescens*) are remarkable amphibians that live in water as juveniles, move onto land as young adults, and then return to water to reproduce. This unique life cycle raises an intriguing question: does the newt's skeleton change shape to adapt to these different environments?

My research uses advanced 3D imaging technology (micro-CT scanning) to capture detailed pictures of newt skeletons across their different life stages. I then apply geometric morphometrics—a technique that analyzes and compares shapes mathematically—to measure exactly how the vertebral column, limbs, and muscles differ between aquatic and terrestrial newts.

Understanding how form relates to function in newts helps us understand broader principles of evolution and adaptation. It also provides insights into biomechanical constraints—the physical trade-offs animals face when their bodies must work in multiple environments. This research contributes to our knowledge of how vertebrates (including our own ancestors) transitioned from aquatic to terrestrial lifestyles millions of years ago.

The ultimate goal is to build computational models that can predict how skeletal shape affects movement and performance, bringing us closer to understanding the biomechanical principles that govern animal locomotion.

## Collaborative Research

### Old World vs New World Fruit Bat Climbing Mechanics

I have contributed to several collaborative projects examining climbing adaptations in fruit bats:

- **Scapula morphology** - Published in *Journal of Zoology* (Adams et al. 2025)
- **Acetabulum shape** - Ongoing project led by undergraduate researcher Jay Higgins
- **Vertebrae morphology** - Ongoing project led by graduate researcher Jessica Upham

These projects apply 3D geometric morphometric techniques to compare skeletal adaptations between arboreal Old World fruit bats and New World fruit bats.
