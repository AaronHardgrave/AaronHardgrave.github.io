## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers on **functional understanding over memorization**. I believe anatomy students should develop the ability to visualize structures and infer their function based on anatomical relationships, preparing them to think anatomically in clinical practice rather than simply recall facts for examinations.

I have extensive experience teaching anatomy across diverse student populations — from first-year medical students to undergraduates to advanced high school students — and I tailor my instructional approach to each audience's professional and academic goals.

## Technology Integration

My research background in µCT imaging informs my teaching approach. I regularly integrate 3D iPad models alongside cadaveric specimens, allowing students to rotate structures and identify attachment points without visual distraction. However, I maintain that **technology should complement, not replace, cadaver-based instruction** — no digital tool can replicate the anatomical variation and spatial relationships students encounter in actual specimens.

## Assessment Philosophy

I emphasize formative assessment through rapid-fire review sessions during laboratories, providing immediate feedback while knowledge is fresh. I create student-centered, accessible learning environments where open communication allows me to adapt instruction to diverse learning needs.

During the Governor's School, I prioritized weekly in-class feedback from students, asking what activities resonated most strongly and where they needed additional support. This responsive approach led to curriculum adjustments, including the incorporation of review games and inviting guest speakers to provide diverse perspectives on biological sciences.
