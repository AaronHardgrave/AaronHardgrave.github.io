## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers on **functional understanding over memorization**. I believe anatomy students should develop the ability to visualize structures and infer their function based on anatomical relationships, preparing them to think anatomically in clinical practice rather than simply recall facts for examinations.

I have extensive experience teaching anatomy across diverse student populations:

### Medical Education (M1/M2 students)

- Co-instructed anatomy laboratories for 84 first- and second-year medical students at ETSU Quillen College of Medicine
- Integrated clinical case studies throughout laboratory instruction
- Facilitated small-group dissection and prosection demonstrations
- Covered thoracic, abdominal, back, extremity, and head/neck anatomy

### Health Sciences (Occupational Therapy students)

- Developed anatomical content tailored to rehabilitative clinical applications
- Emphasized movement, function, and therapeutic interventions
- Utilized prosection-based laboratory formats

### Undergraduate & Advanced High School

- Primary instructor for Biology I and II for majors, including Governor's School residential program
- Delivered lectures on cellular processes, organismal biology, ecology, and evolution
- Incorporated group work, student presentations, and modern molecular techniques

## Technology Integration

My research background in µCT imaging informs my teaching approach. I regularly integrate 3D iPad models alongside cadaveric specimens, allowing students to rotate structures and identify attachment points without visual distraction. However, I maintain that **technology should complement, not replace, cadaver-based instruction**—no digital tool can replicate the anatomical variation and spatial relationships students encounter in actual specimens.

## Assessment Philosophy

I emphasize formative assessment through rapid-fire review sessions during laboratories, providing immediate feedback while knowledge is fresh. I create student-centered, accessible learning environments where open communication allows me to adapt instruction to diverse learning needs.

During the Governor's School, I prioritized weekly in-class feedback from students, asking what activities resonated most strongly and where they needed additional support. This responsive approach led to curriculum adjustments, including the incorporation of review games using Kahoot and inviting guest speakers to provide diverse perspectives on biological sciences. By treating students as partners in the learning process, I create an environment where their voices shape our shared educational experience.
