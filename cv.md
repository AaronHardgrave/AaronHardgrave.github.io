## Availability

Expected graduation: **Spring 2026**

I am currently seeking faculty positions in anatomy at medical schools, veterinary schools, health sciences programs, and biology departments. I am also open to postdoctoral positions that would expand my technical expertise in biomechanics, kinematics, anatomy education, or clinical research methods.
